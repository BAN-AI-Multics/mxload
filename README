This is version 1.1.  Revision history:

 1.1x   04-11-15  Released for general use.  No software changes.

 1.1    93-10-31  Major restructuring of I/O to support reading from standard
                  input, needed for systems with poor tape device drivers
		  (specifically, Sequent).  Minor memory management fixes.

 1.0.5  91-12-20  Bug fix for local map generation ("-l" option).

 1.0.4  91-12-03  Changed to make WORDALIGN the default in the Makefile (now
                  works out of the box on SPARC, etc.).  Bug fix to WORDALIGN
                  gettype.c to declare a missing variable and loop through 8
                  bytes instead of 9.

 1.0.3  90-10-22  Bug fix to preserving broken archives as files, rather than
                  discarding them.  Includes "WORDALIGN" definition in the
		  Makefile to fix word alignment problems.

 1.0.2  89-10-24  Bug fix for mxmbx handling old (V4) message segments.

 1.0.1  89-05-26  Bug fix for tape buffer problems, revised documentation.

 1.0    89-01-13  Initial release
